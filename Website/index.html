		<p> Have you ever experienced forgetting about an assignment your teacher assigned you? Or maybe you forgot about an exam that you had to take today? This website aims to provide a better place to plan, arrange, chart, and schedule things. That way it lessens the chance of you forgetting something important. </p>
		<p> Students tend to forget important things due to lack of organization and time management. I often find myself doing things at the last minute because I didnâ€™t remember
to do something or due to lack of motivation. I wished there was a more systematic way and fun way of arranging my tasks so that I actually feel inspired doing it. Then I thought, why not do it myself? </p>
		<p> Check Point is a study website that lets you create timetables, to-do lists, put inspirational quotes, track your progress, and many more. I personally feel more motivated to list everything on my computer rather than a diary or notebook because it feels more organized. As someone who has messy handwriting, typing it instead looks so much more pleasing. </p>
